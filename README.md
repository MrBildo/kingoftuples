C#7+ Tuples and Deconstruction

This project began life as an inside joke on our team slack. I was preaching the virtues of Tuples to my co-workers (as I've been prone to do for years) when it was suggested I reserve the domain name 'kingoftuples.com'. As a joke, I did! It was then suggested it should point at a repository. So I thought I would throw some code together that helped explain Tuples and also some examples of their use.

If you are new to Tuples, I'd suggest starting with projects 1 and 2.

Any and all feedback is welcome.

The king of classes is dead, long live the king of tuples!
